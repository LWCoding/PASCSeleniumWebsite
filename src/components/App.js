Game development may be the interest for you!\n\nThis club will be mainly interested in developing a conceptual understanding of the structures that make up video games and some syntax in the C# programming language. We'll be working towards gaining familiarity with the Unity Engine (which has created some VERY popular games, such as Hearthstone, Hollow Knight, Pok√©mon Go, Among Us), but downloading it isn't a prerequisite!\n\nThis club is also a community to develop or refine your creative skills, with the hopes of you creating projects of your own or as a team! We hope to see you there.",
