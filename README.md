# PASC Selenium Website

This project is a potential redesign of the official enrichment-selection website called [Selenium](https://wpcp.selenium.org) for Walter Payton College Preparatory High School. It attempts to offer the same features of the original website, but add the additional mechanic of allowing students to submit proposals to create clubs. This recreation of the website does not exist as a replacement for the website, but an alternative design / side-project to help me further explore website development in the React framework.
