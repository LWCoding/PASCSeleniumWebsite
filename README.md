# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a recreation of the website [Selenium](https://wpcp.selenium.org) that controls students' Enrichment
decisions for Walter Payton College Preparatory high school. This does not exist as a replacement for the website,
but an alternative design / side-project to help me further explore website development in the React framework.
